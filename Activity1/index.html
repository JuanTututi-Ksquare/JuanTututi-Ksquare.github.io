      <p>
        H.P. Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island. He was an American
        author of fantastic and macabre short novels and stories, one of the
        20th-century masters of the Gothic tale of terror, notably influenced by
        the works of Edgar Allan Poe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lovecraft was interested in science from childhood, but lifelong poor
        health prevented him from attending college. He made his living as a
        ghostwriter and rewrite man and spent most of his life in seclusion and
        poverty. His fame as a writer increased after his death.

      <p>
        From 1923 on, most of Lovecraft’s short stories appeared in the magazine
        Weird Tales. His Cthulhu Mythos series of tales describe ordinary New
        Englanders’ encounters with horrific beings of extraterrestrial origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        In these short stories, Lovecraft’s intimate knowledge of New England’s
        geography and culture is blended with an elaborate original mythology.
        His other short stories deal with similarly terrifying phenomena in
        which horror and morbid fantasy acquire an unexpected verisimilitude.
        Lovecraft was a master of poetic language, and he attained unusually
        high literary standards in his particular fictional genre.

      <p>
        Lovecraftian horror, sometimes used interchangeably with "cosmic horror"
        is a subgenre of horror fiction and weird fiction that emphasizes the
        horror of the unknowable and incomprehensible more than gore or other
        elements of shock. It is named after American author H. P. Lovecraft
        (1890–1937).
      </p>
      <p>
        His work emphasizes themes of cosmic dread, forbidden and dangerous
        knowledge, madness, non-human influences on humanity, religion and
        superstition, fate and inevitability, and the risks associated with
        scientific discoveries, which are now associated with Lovecraftian
        horror as a subgenre. The cosmic themes of Lovecraftian horror can also
        be found in other media, notably horror films, horror games and comics.
