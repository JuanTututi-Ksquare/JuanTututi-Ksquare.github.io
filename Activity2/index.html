      <h2 class="article-title">History of Zacapu</h2>
      <p>
        Zacapu is a municipality in the Mexican state of Michoacán de Ocampo .
        It is located 61 km from Pátzcuaro and 80 km from Morelia.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name Zacapu comes from the Chichimeca expression that is interpreted
        as "stone" or "stony place". Cecilio Robelo , in his work
        Tarasco-Hispano-Nahoa Toponymy , indicates that it comes from Tarascan
        and that the expression Tzacapu haracucuaro translates as "Quarry where
        they take out stone". Other authors point to the spelling Tzácapu for
        the Purépecha word that means "stone". This is because Zacapu is
        sorrounded by extinct vulcanos.

      <p>
        The most famous local food in Zacapu alongside with the municipality of
        Quiroga, Michoacan are the famous Carnitas de Puerco. This dish is an
        exquisite mixure of pork meat. An inexpensive, heavily marbled cut of
        pork, such as boneless Boston butt, pork shoulder or picnic ham, is
        braised or simmered for several hours with seasonings and lard until it
        is so tender that is can be shredded. At the end of cooking, the meat is
        roasted to make it crisp. Carnitas is a dish served on its own with
        salsa and sides, and carnitas is also used as a filling for tacos,
        burritos, or enchiladas.
